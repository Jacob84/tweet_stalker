At the current stage, only on-demand tracking is done. The desired features are:
 - Download periodically tweets from the selected lists and perform NLP analysis.
 - Decent web application to show the feeds.
 - Automatic categorizing of the tweets and web push notifications.
 - More statistics (graphs of relations between accounts, etc)
